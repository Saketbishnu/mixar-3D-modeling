    Mesh Normalization, Quantization & Error Analysis
    Author: Saket Bishnu
    Files processed: 8 meshes

    Methods used:
    - Min-Max normalization + 1024-bin quantization
    - Unit Sphere normalization + 1024-bin quantization
    - (Optional) Z-score normalization (if enabled)

    For each mesh, the following are saved:
    - normalized mesh (.obj)
    - quantized integer array (.npy)
    - visual quantized mesh (.obj)
    - reconstructed mesh (.obj)
    - per-axis error plot (.png)
    - errors json (.json)

    Use summary.json to build tables of MSE/MAE and include screenshots/plots in the final PDF report.
